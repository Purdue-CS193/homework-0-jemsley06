# Jason Emsley's First CS193 Homework

### My favorite things about CS193:
- The course is run by current students, so the content is tailored to what will actually help me as a CS major
- Many (or all!!) of the tools I'll learn are not taught in CS180, but are extremely useful for any projects (academic or personal) I will build
- Only need to meet once a week, even if it's at 6:30 :(

### A little bit about me, in case I use this website in the future

I am first-semester freshman studying CS at Purdue University. Because you are probably one of the course leads reading this website to grade HW1, I just want you to know that yes twin, WE are getting FAANG internships.

<sub> note that I will be keeping the guide below for the time being </sub>
